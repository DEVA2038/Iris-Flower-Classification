🔍 Project Overview:
Using the famous Iris dataset, I built a machine learning model to classify flowers into one of three species:
🌸 Iris Setosa
🌿 Iris Versicolor
🌺 Iris Virginica

📊 What I Did:
✅ Preprocessed the dataset for training
✅ Explored data visually using Seaborn and Matplotlib
✅ Trained multiple classification models like:

Logistic Regression

Support Vector Machine (SVM)

Decision Tree

✅ Evaluated model performance using:

Accuracy Score

Confusion Matrix

Visualization of classification results

⚙️ Tools & Libraries:
Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn

📈 Key Learnings:

Gained hands-on experience in model building & evaluation

Understood core concepts of classification algorithms

Learned the importance of feature selection and data preprocessing

This beginner-friendly project was a great way to start applying machine learning in real-world scenarios.
